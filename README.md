# Games
Games I have created over the course of the summer, learned from iDTech (coded using C++).

Games include: Tetris, Pong, Jump Game, and a Game of Life Simulator.

SFML must be installed for the program to run and you must use Microsoft Visual Studio,
using this link: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/ (download the top right option - Visual C++ (2017) 64-bit).
