# Games
Games I have created over the course of the summer (2019), learned from iDTech (coded using C++).

Games include: Checkers, Jump Game, Tetris, and Conway's 'Game of Life Simulator.

SFML must be installed for the program to run and you must use Microsoft Visual Studio,
using this link: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.1/ (download the top right option - Visual C++ (2017) 64-bit).
